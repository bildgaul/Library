This program is a BookStoreInventory program called library! In order to use
the program you must first select the "Build an inventory from a file" option
and specify the file you want to read in (preferably a .dat fle). The program
will build an inventory using the file that quickly searches for a book using
its title!
Features:
	- library allows you to add files to the current inventory by selecting
	the "Build an inventory from a file" feature and providing a file name
	(preferably a .dat file). If no inventory exists,
	library will build a new inventory, and will insert any new data on top
	of the already existing inventory!
	- library lets you save the current inventory to your computer. You can
	do this by selecting the "Write the inventory to a file" option on the
	menu and then typing the filename of the file you wish to save
	(preferably a .dat file).
	- You can print the current inventory by selecting the "Print the
	inventory" feature on the menu.
	- You can search for a book using a substring of the book by selecting
	the "Search the stock of the books whos titles match a substring"
	option on the menu and providing a substring to search with. If a book
	title contains the substring, it's details will be printed.
	- You can delete a book from the inventory using a substring by
	selecting the "Delete a book or books from the inventory whos titles
	match a substring" option on the menu and providing a substring. If a
	book title contains the substring, it will be deleted.

Bugs: The insert function does not save the title of the book, and the
comparison overwrites the current node. I have no idea if any of the other
functions are properly implemented and working due to insert not properly
inserting the book data.

I learned to not wait until your partner is done to ask if it's OK to be the
third person in their group. I have no partner and am doing this by myself
on the last day.
